"""Place NYPD records (arrests, complaints, shootings) in 2020 census tracts.

NYPD puts a record it cannot geocode, and every rape complaint (to protect the
victim), at the station house of the precinct where it happened. Left alone,
those records pile up in whichever tract holds the station house. In 2024, about a quarter of
arrests of people under 25 sat within 130 meters of their own precinct's station
house; in the first half of 2026, 94% of rape complaints did.

This module finds those station-house records and spreads them across the
precinct in proportion to where the precinct's other records of the same kind
were located. Totals are preserved; only the location of the station-house share
is estimated. Everything is documented in methodology.html.

Station houses come from data/stations.json (built by fetch_youth.py from each
precinct's NYPD web page, geocoded with NYC Planning's GeoSearch).
